#  Report #2 : **Back-end Weekly Checkpoint #2**



**(Q1)*What has your team accomplished in the past week?***

- Made a JSON-based non-live DB connected CRUD API
- Connected our API to the Database with limited functionality

**(Q2)*Did your team encounter unexpected hurdles? How will your team work through any hurdle**?* 

- We've encountered many hurtles including ones in general python-functionality, communication, work allocation and cross-group architectural understanding.
    - Python has thrown us many new extensions to learn and try. With all the options and different ways of doing so, it's been a hard thing to be able to understand which ones to use when.
    - Work allocation has been difficult, our group has varying experience working on a back-end system, and the current file system of the whole project and back end project is somewhat confusing
        - **Solution: (A)** Spend class time for all group's to come to a common understanding of the file system.
            - (B) Set class time for groups to review their portion of the repository

**(*Q3)What tools worked, what didnâ€™t?***

**What worked:**

- Parsing the Databases responses into JSON strings then python objects(dicts) that are easy to manipulate and send back to the front end!

**What didnt:**

- When working on the CRUD API, mysqldb didn't work on most systems.
    - Setting up a server on campus or a rasbperry pi (for now)
- Testing the front end hitting the backend
    - This works on its own, given a javascript file that calls the API using a fetch(), however we have yet to see a frontend implementation/testing the API

**(Q4)***:*Discuss with your team as a group what should be tackled for the upcoming week. Will there be any shifts or changes in the features your team will be working on? Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish?

### In the coming week we're working on tackling

- Getting api calls from the front end's javascript, preferably sending the API/us JSON with identifiable information as to what should happen when.
- Establishing a strategy of who/how authentication will happen, will the front end be handling this, if so with sessions or jasonwebtokens?

**(Q4)**Your team will give a brief update to the class. A written version shall be submitted within a week, earlier is better. **


## Our ask from other teams:
- Contact us if there is a feature that you could use our support with.
- **Database team:** Finish documentation/Specifications on how they expect us to send data (ie a username to lookup) and how they will send it back (ie as a JSON).
    - Detailed comments from method headers + ReadMe with examples would be appreciated
- **Front-end team :** Get Documentation/specs on how they expect us to send data (ie a username to lookup in json form) and how they will send it back (ie as a JSON).
- Any feedback and suggestions on how we should set up the app's API/Backend architecture.
