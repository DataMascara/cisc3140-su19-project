                  <p class = "theText"> The story of this application began one bright summer day when our Computer Science class was assigned a class project. The developers had to divide into teams and figure out what kind of project to implement. It was very hard at first to decide which developer would undertake which role, but after a few days all confussions were eliminated. Everybody began working on their task, so that at the end of the semester, the most beautiful project in the world would be created. All of this required huge efforts and time, and all teammates had to communicate with one another on a daily basis to resolve various conflict and misunderstandings and to notify each other about their progress. The website that you are using right now is the fruit of all this hard work.<br><br>Enjoy browsing!<br><br>&lt Some text by the Product team here ...&gt<br><br>Lorem Ipsum:<br><br>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
